# UHTec Blog

This is the repository for my personal blog [UHTec](http://uhtec.com).

The Blog uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), an open source, fast & modern static site generator. I like the fact that Hugo is written in Go and focuses on speed. There are a lot of interesting features and I only barely scratched the surface of its capabilities. I'm using the [Hugo Identity Theme](https://github.com/aerohub/hugo-identity-theme) by [Pavel Kanyshev](https://github.com/aerohub). The theme is based on [Identity template by HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/identity).
