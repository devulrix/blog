# UHTec Blog

This is the repository for my personal blog [UHTec](http://uhtec.com).

The Blog uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), an open source, fast & modern static site generator. I like the fact that Hugo is written in Go and focuses on speed. There are a lot of interesting features and I only barely scratched the surface of its capabilities. I'm using the [HugoMDL theme](https://github.com/jchatkinson/HugoMDL) by [Jeremy Atkinson](http://jatkinson.me/). The theme is based on Google's [Material Design Lite](https://www.getmdl.io/).

I use Gulp to manage the sources and automatically build the static folder for Hugo. 

To get everything running:

```
gulp
```
