I’m the author of this personal blog. I'm a Systems Engineer working for EMC in West Germany. Besides being interested in Computer Science and technology in general, I love to travel.

My first exposure to programming was on a Commodore C64. After my first experiments with BASIC I moved on to C++. At school I was exposed to Delphi and learned to love Java.
I studied Computer Science at the RWTH Aachen University with a focus on Computer Graphics and Massively Distributed Systems. In my Diploma thesis I combined these two fields and developed and indoor navigation systems for smartphones based on WiFi, voxels and sensor data. The WiFi propagation was derived from a raytracer model using the university's GPU Cluster.

I'm currently interested in DevOps and agile development methods. I love to experiment with new ideas and technologies and see how I can adopt these techniques in my work life. Though this blog won't be dedicated to technologies from EMC, I'm sure that there will be a focus and bias towards EMC and the EMC Federation (VMware, Pivotal, VCE, RSA) in general.

The views expressed anywhere on this site are strictly mine and not the opinions and views of EMC.
