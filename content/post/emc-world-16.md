This year I'll be part of the EMC World 2016. I use this blog entry to post about my experience and what I learn. This will be an ongoing post for the next 5 days. The conference takes place in the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas.

I just completed my registration and as an EMC Proven Professional you get an additional T-Shirt and a sticker for your badge.

I started my first time at EMC World with a DevOps session by Matt Cowger. The presentation was a nice introduction to the world of DevOps and what it means for your organization. Additionally he showed us how the four topics: DevOps, CI/CD, Microservices, Container influence each other and that you cannot have one without the others.

We had a German customer lunch and learn event with a very special guest. We had Joe Tucci and Dinko on stage, Joe told us about his plans after EMC. The focus will be on his family, he'll be available for advice for Michael.

My favorite session of EMC World 2016 was the Unik Session by Edit Levin. Her presentation of the unikernel idea and how to enable IoT with Unik was brilliant.

After an awesome week in Vegas, I'm flying back to Germany. The leg room on the plan could be better, but I really appreciate the opportunity to be part of the last EMC World.
