---

In this post I would like to introduce you to my new project [Everything as Code](http://www.everything-as-code.de). This project was born by me and by [@mydigama](https://twitter.com/MyDigamma). The idea of Everything as Code developed around the [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Everything-as-code-Online-Meetup/). We wonted to create a Meetup, but we live in North Rhine Westphalia, which has multiple dense populated areas and not only one major city. Our goal was to make the Meetup as accessible as possible, so we decided to create an Online Meetup. Go to the website and have a look at our latest posting.

The focus of the Meetup is about everything that can be run with code. This involves classic infrastructure as well as software development topics. We started our Meetup with a series around Docker. Containers are a hot topic at the moment and I get a lot of confusion by my customers. This gave us the idea to create a introductory Meetup around the basic Docker topics.

Besides creating a Meetup we chose to create a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4d2lgIJa9FhQeVqUaFx1BQ). We use YouTube for doing our Online Meetups. We use the YouTube Live Stream function and broadcast directly from my Laptop. This gives us an easy way for everybody to consume the content (you don't need a special account). As an additional bonus, every Meetup gets recorded and can be watch at a later time. Have a look at our first online Meetup:

During the Meetup you can post questions with the help of the YouTube Chat Box or you can use our Slack channel: [everything-as-code](http://www.everything-as-code.de/slack.html). We chose to create a Slack channel because we would like to create a community around the topics. With a normal Meetup it's complicated to discuss or share additional information after the Meetup, the Slack channel gives us the opportunity to chat about topics outside the normal Meetup schedule.

As the channel develops further we plan to introduce additional topics besides Docker. The feedback we got from the communiy was the they're still very interested in additional Docker topics, so we introduced the Docker Thursday. We plan to have a biweekly video on different topics around Docker.

Our next topic will be Splunk, we already setup a [Meetup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3VrgnCMjM) to an introduction with our partner [Dextra Data](http://www.dextradata.com/) for the 30th of August 2016.
