This is my first post to my new blog.

I previously had a blog during my work at the university. This was based on Wordpress. I recently had the urge to blog again and write down my thoughts. I just wanted to focus on writing and be able to use github for storing and versioning. This made me look into static site generators.

I just started working with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), an open source, fast & modern static site generator. I like the fact that Hugo is written in Go and focuses on speed. There are a lot of interesting features and I only barely scratched the surface of its capabilities. I'm using the [HugoMDL theme](https://github.com/jchatkinson/HugoMDL) by [Jeremy Atkinson](http://jatkinson.me/). The theme is bases on Google's [Material Design Lite](https://www.getmdl.io/) which is most famously used in Android 5+.

I plan to regularly post about the different things I learned, problems I’m encountering, and random other interesting things.
